Using OneLockBlockingQueue
Number of elements in test file : 10000000
Pre-allocate with 25000001 elements
Using Allocator
Allocating objects of size : 16
n_producers = 2
n_consumers = 2
Creating producers and consumers
Producer data
0, 5000000, 10.4557
1, 5000000, 9.9375
Consumer data
0, 4882652, 10.4557
1, 5117348, 10.4557
Verifying correctness
Equal : All inserted elements are present in the queue
Total time taken = 10.4563
Total produced = 10000000
Total consumed = 10000000
Verification successful
