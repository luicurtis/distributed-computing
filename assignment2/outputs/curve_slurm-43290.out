WARNING : Your parallel execution time (5.4783) is more than the serial execution time (5.0).
Ideally, your execution time should less than  5.0
Your parallel execution time, T : 5.4783 seconds
Expected parallel execution time, T_expected : 1.2 seconds
Ideally, T should be equal to (or less than) T_expected
WARNING : Your parallel execution time (5.4783 seconds) is more than 1.5 times higher than the expected parallel execution time (1.2 seconds).
Ideally, your execution time should be around 1.2 seconds
